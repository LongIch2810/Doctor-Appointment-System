Use this tool to provide general medical and healthcare-related guidance. It is designed to generate informative responses based on public medical knowledge, covering topics such as:

- Common symptoms and possible conditions
- Over-the-counter or prescription medications
- Health tips, wellness, and self-care advice
- Explanations of medical terminology or procedures

‚ö†Ô∏è This tool is intended for informational purposes only and does **not** replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. It does **not** access internal clinic databases or documents. For structured data (e.g., number of doctors) or internal policies, use the appropriate SQL or RAG tool.

üìå The response will be automatically generated in the **same language** as the user's question (e.g., English, Vietnamese, etc.) to ensure clarity and natural understanding.

üëâ Whenever the issue may be serious or unclear, the response should **always recommend the user consult a qualified medical professional or visit a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.**
