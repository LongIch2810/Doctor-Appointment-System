Use this tool to answer user questions related to clinic operations, including internal regulations, procedures, and available medical services. 
It retrieves and summarizes relevant information from internal documents stored in a vector database using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

This tool is ideal for:
- Answering questions about clinic policies or service guidelines.
- Providing details from onboarding materials or internal documentation.
- Clarifying procedures, roles, or rules defined within the organization.

Do **not** use this tool for general knowledge, database statistics, or structured data queries ‚Äî use the appropriate SQL tool instead in those cases.

üìå The response will be automatically generated in the **same language** as the user's question (e.g., English, Vietnamese, etc.), ensuring consistent and natural communication.
