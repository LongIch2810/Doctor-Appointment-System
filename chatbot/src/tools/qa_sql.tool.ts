Use this tool to answer factual questions by directly querying a PostgreSQL medical database. 
It is suitable for questions that require structured information such as:

- The number of doctors, articles, or specialties.
- Lists of doctors, specialties, or medical articles.
- Doctor-related details like experience, workplace, or specialization.
- Any other query that can be answered using structured tabular data.

Do **not** use this tool for general knowledge, advice, or opinion-based questions.

The tool automatically generates SQL queries from the user's question, runs them on the database, and summarizes the result.

ðŸ“Œ Return the answer in **HTML format using Tailwind CSS** â€” this HTML will be rendered in the UI. Use simple responsive card or table layouts with Tailwind classes for formatting.

ðŸ“Œ The response must remain in the **same language** as the user's question (e.g., English, Vietnamese).
